							<h1>Welcome. I'm <strong>Diego Avena</strong>.</h1>
						</header>
						<p>I am situated in Whittier, Southern California, and recently graduated from Chapman University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor and Game development. I currently am working on finishing up a 2D platformer game I started with a group of friends from Chapman University; it is called Sengoku (feel free to check out my section on it if you are interested)</p>
						<p>
							I really started getting into programming after playing Minecraft. I was amazed at how such a game can be developed, and I remember seeing this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BES9EKK4Aw4">video</a> where the creator, Notch, plays around with the mechanics of
							the game just by changing a bit of Java code, and I knew then that programming was something I wanted to learn. Some other big motivators were games like The Last of Us: the game's ability to make the player feel like they are actually in
							the stories' apocalyptic world to the impact the story leaves on the player at the end - all of this showed me how powerful programming can be and I wanted to learn it even more.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am also very interested in outer space, and this was another big motivator for getting into computer science. The software that guided all of those rockets in space, from the Saturn 5 rocket to the numerous landings made by NASA rovers on Mars - all of this
							was really inspiring and only made me want to learn programming even more.
						</p>
						<p>
							Besides programming, I also (you could have probably guessed this) like playing video games (Hollow Knight and Ori and the Will of the Wisps being my favorites as of now). On my spare time, I also enjoy designing and building my own creations out of the lego
							collection I managed to accumulate over many years. I am also really into architecture, and occasionally sketch out some house drawings.
						</p>
						<p>Well, that's enough about me for now. <strong>On this website I have collected links to all of my programming work and game dev projects.</strong> Feel free to check them out! You can also play a couple of the games I have worked on!</p>
						<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
